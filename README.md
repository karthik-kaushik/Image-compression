# Hardware Implementation of an Image Decompressor
## Objective
To try and implement a custom Image compression specification in hardware
Compressed data for a 320x240 image will be delivered and image decoding algorithm will recover the original image or visa versa.

We will focus only on colorspace conversion first. 

## colorspace conversion

we start with a RGB format image. this is converted to YUV format. Y represents brightness and U and V are chrominance components that contain color info
the U and V values are further downsampled to compress the data by a third of the size,

The Human eye is much more sensitive to brightness than color. for this reason we choose to downsample U and V. As brightness, which is the Y layer, is where the majority of any perceived image data is, much of the image's quality is preserved.

each RGB pixel is converted to YUV by performing a matrix multiplication using a specific formula.
 
to upsample the U and V layers for de-compression, the data ,which is in even columns, is used as folllows. the even columns will become unsampled image's even columns, the odd columns are generated by horizontal interpolation.
